    "   - Remove columns where all values are missing or equal to zero.\n",
    "   - Describe the basic statistics (mean, minimum, maximum, standard deviation, etc.) of the numerical variables.\n",

    "2. Perform all data pre-processing steps needed for the model (i.e., integration, cleaning, reduction, and transformation). **(7 pts)**  \n",
    "   For each pre-processing step that you apply, dedicate at least one markdown cell next to the code to explain:\n",
    "   - the step you are applying\n",

    "6. Create plots of training and validation losses. Describe the trends you notice and whether they indicate underfitting or overfitting behaviors. **(2 pts)**\n",
